### How to use this Repository?

You can use this repository either locally or with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

Binder is a tool that runs a repository into a collection of interactive notebooks. This will install [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file into the backend server so that notebooks will already have all packages needed.

Use the following link to create a binder for this repository. 

> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spu-dataviz-211/class-materials/HEAD)

To install locally, follow the list below.

1. Download this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/spu-dataviz-211/class-materials.git`.
2. Download python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), if you don't have python already on your computer.
3. [Create a virtual environment](#how-to-create-a-new-virtual-environment) and activate this environment everytime you need to use it.
4. Install [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. That's it. 

Following are the recommendations.

6. Read the README file for each section.
7. For some sections, there will be `Examples.ipynb` and `Examples-Solutions.ipynb` files. These will have some examples, and their solutions on the related topic.
8. There will also be `Notes.ipynb`, which may have some more content about the topic.
9. Follow up with the assignments to practice more.

### How to create a new Virtual Environment?

Environment is a container for your application to run isolated with safely and without interrupting any other existing applications in the same machine.

Make sure you have python installed on your system.

```
python --version; pip --version
```

To create a virtual environment, you need a virtual environment manager. By default, python comes up with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module. There are more modules like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), etc.

In below command, using python, you are invoking `venv` module to create a new virtual environment folder with name `.venv`, in the current directory that you are in.

``` sh
python -m venv .venv
```

To activate the environment, you do the following.

``` ps
# on windows
 me@MacBook-Pro ~ .\.venv\Scripts\Activate

# on mac
 me@MacBook-Pro ~ source .venv/bin/activate

# your console will change to this
(.venv) me@MacBook-Pro ~ 
```
